- Should be readable and meaningful, reduce cognitive load, be concise, avoid complex nesting and big code blocks, 
- Follow best practices and patterns

## Course Structure

## Clean Code and Patterns & Principles


| Clean Code  | Clean Architecture   |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| How you write code | Where to write which code |
| Focus on single problems/files  | Focus on project as a whole |

Clean code is written over time
- You will always find ways of improving your code
- Your code will need to change
- Question old code and refactor


### Benefits
Refactoring today is work you can save tomorrow
- a codebase can only survive and stay maintainable if its continously improved and refactored

**Tip: whenever you add something new, try to improve existing code along the way**
